Write and deploy a simple native Contacts app. Store a list of persons, containing the following fields:

- first name
- last name
- date of birth
- zero or more addresses
- one or more phone numbers
- one or more emails. 

We’re looking for basic CRUD functionality and Search. Any bells and whistles are welcome and encouraged. This is your opportunity to impress us. Make this as real and as awesome as you can. This is more important than your resume. The goal of this exercise is to see how little hand-holding you need, for you to be able to do your job effectively.

Please make sure:
1. There is NO login or signup required to access the app
2. The app is named “Android Code Test {firstname} {lastname}”
3. The APK is named ““Android Code Test {firstname} {lastname}.apk”
4. The APK is sent as an attachment by itself, not in a zip file
5. The subject of the email is “Android Code Test {firstname} {lastname}”
6. Include the source as a link to github, gitlab or any other online source repository
